<h1 style="font-style: italic">We Shall Fight on the Beaches, 1940</h1>

<p>From the moment that the French defences at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a
rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of
the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realised. The French High Command hoped they would be able to
close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved
almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium.
Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realised and when a new French Generalissimo, General
Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to
keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to
have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.</p>

<p>However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine
armoured divisions, each of about four hundred armoured vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary
and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our
own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way
up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armoured and mechanised onslaught came a number of
German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary
German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which
they have never known in their own.</p>
